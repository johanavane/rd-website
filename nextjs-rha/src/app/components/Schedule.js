            Hi! I'm Rachel, an expert hair colorist based in Orange County.
            Thank you for choosing me for your hair needs.

          <p>
            New clients, please schedule a 15-30 minute in-person consultation
            for a personalized discussion about your hair. This will also help
            me get to know you.

          <p>I look forward to meeting you!</p>
